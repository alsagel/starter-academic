abstract = "The present article analyzes graduates‟ evaluation of their training its usefulness in their current occupation. The aim is to analyze if there are differences in the evaluation depending on students‟ gender and family educational background. In turn, the study addresses whether graduates‟ working conditions affect these evaluations. Results show the existence of significant differences between the young depending on their social origin and gender. Women and working class graduates are more likely to make a better assessment of their university training. Finally, holding graduates‟ employment situation as a control variable, we verify that in some cases these differences are due to the current working environment of the graduates rather than to demographic differences."
