  abstract = {The aim of this communication is to explore and analyse students' motivations in compulsory education and examine whether these motivations affect differentially their future expectations. The concrete objectives of this study are twofold: 1.Explore previous empirical and empirical theoretical approaches on students' motivations and attitudes. 2.Propose a typology of attitudes towards the studies and characterize it according to sociodemographic variables and future expectations after compulsory education. The communication will show the results of one part of a larger piece of the International Study of City Youth (ISCY). This is an international longitudinal study of 10th Grade students to find out more about student journeys through school into further study, work and life beyond school. The first student survey was carried out in 27 schools in Barcelona and filled in by 2000 students in their last year of secondary compulsory education (4th ESO) or students born in 1998 (enrolled in lower courses that would correspond).},
